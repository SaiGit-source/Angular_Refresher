What are Decorators?
Functions that return functions
Supplies metadata, tells Angular what the code should do
How it should inject that code into other parts of the application
Decorators are marked using an @ symbol in front of the decorator name
They are invoked at runtime and expect arguments to be passed either between the parenthesis or immediately after closing the parenthesis


Common decorators:
@NgModule() to define modules
@Components to define components
@Injectable() to define services
@Pipe() to define pipes
@Directive to define directives
@Input() for data flowing into a component
@Output for data flowing out of a component
Input() and Output() to define properties that send and receive data from the dom.

Decorator Errors:
Missing parenthesis, properties, property values, adding a semicolon at the end of decorator statement
use 'ng build' and 'ng serve' command to check for errors
