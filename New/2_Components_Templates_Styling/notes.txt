Components:

Components are like building blocks of Angular application like Lego piece

Say your website has a Header, Main (List and elements in the list) and Footer. they all might be different Components

Components are central elements of an Angular application
They control a portion of the screen called the view
They also handle logic and data for the view's functionality

A component is a special TypeScript class that interacts with an HTML template to display information and handle user interactions
These components help break UI into chunks. cleaner and easy to maintain code

go to the course-booking-system folder then run 
ng generate component courses-list

We want to have a list of courses here: 
To add a new course, i got to copy and paste it

<div class="course-item">
    <h3>Introducton to Angular</h3>
    <p>This course covers the basics of Angular development.</p>
    <p>$100</p>
    <p>03-01-2026</p>
    <button>View Details</button>
</div>

how do we add courses dynamically? Data binding
Data binding is some sort of bridge that connects component's data and the HTML template
it allows the view to reflect the underlying data model seemlessly

Data binding is the process of connecting the data in our TypeScript class to our HTML template
this ensures, when my data changes, the view updates automatically. 


Two-way data binding: the two-way interaction makes our application dynamically respond without the need for DOM manipulation

One-way data binding: the data flows from the component to the view or the HTML file
Component ts file ===> View HTML file  ex: <h2>{{title}}</h2>

Property binding: Allows us to set properties of HTML elements or directives based on component data
Instructions for specific parts of the view based on what's happening in the component
[property]="expression". it could be a property in the 'ts' file
