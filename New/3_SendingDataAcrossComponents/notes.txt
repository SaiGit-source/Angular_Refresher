Sending data across components

Parent Child communication: when we have one component inside another component
ng generate component course-card
course-card will help us display course details in a neat and reusable card format

The @Input Decorator: for communicating from the parent to the child. pass data down to child
We can make our component dynamic instead of hard-coding, make our component reuable and flexible

The purpose of the decorator is to mark a property as an input property, allowing data to flow from parent to child
At Parent component, bind to the child's @Input property using property binding syntax, In child, use @Input to receive data

@Output decorator: Child communicating back to Parent. we have to use @Output() on the child combined with event emitters
@Output marks a property as an output property allowing child to emit events to parent. we need to specify a function in the parent to handle the event emitted from the child.
