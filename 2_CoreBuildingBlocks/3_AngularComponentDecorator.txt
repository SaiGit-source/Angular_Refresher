Angular Component Decorator

Angular components are the main building blocks

Components have four parts:
1. HTML template that defines UI for the component
2. CSS styles to apply to the template
3. TypeScript class that controls the component's behavior
4. Component selector that tells Angular where to put the component in the DOM

Common uses:
1. Build whole pages for navigation
2. Build reusable bit of UI
3. We write components in the same way no matter how we use them


Component decorator takes configuration object as its only argument. 
The selector property tells Angular where to use the component in the DOM

@Component({
  selector: 'app-players',
  templateUrl: './players.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./players.component.css']
})

try to have atleast one '-' in the selector and it is the convention  'app-players' to avoid collisions with standard HTML elements like button or input
templateUrl: tells Angular which file to use as HTML for this component

this also works
template: '<h1>Hello World</h1>'

we can use template or templateUrl but not at the same time

styleUrls: is the array of files that define CSS styles. we can use any absolute or relative URL here

style: ['.input-group { color: red; }']
