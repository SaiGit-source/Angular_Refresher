Angular Components are the main building blocks in all Angular apps

you can't use Angular without Components

  public players$: Observable<Player[] | undefined> = of(undefined);
it has an initial value of Observable that returns undefined
it's a type of promise but for data that returns more than once
players$ : putting $ sign at the end of observable is a naming convention in Angular


 constructor(
    private api: ApiService
  ) { }

  this is the constructor for our Components class. this is where we inject dependencies and initialize code


  public ngOnInit(): void {
    this.players$ = this.api.getAllPlayers$();
  }

this is a lifecycle hook built into Angular. it is a way to tell Angular when to execute certain pieces of code

getAllPlayers$() we use this method on our API Service to get all the players
$ sign is not required but it makes it clear the service returns an Observable of some kind
